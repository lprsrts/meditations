This is the process. Every day sketches, brainfarts and ideas flying around in my backpack and apartment. I hope they can inspire or help someone out there.

Creativity isn't a straight line. It's a winding path with unexpected turns and discoveries. Some days the ideas flow freely, and other days they hide in the shadows, requiring patience and persistence to coax them out.

The most important thing is to keep showing up. Keep making marks on the page, keep typing words, keep building. The process itself is where the magic happens, not just in the final product.
