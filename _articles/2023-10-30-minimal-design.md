Less is more. The principles of minimal design focus on removing the unnecessary to emphasize what truly matters. This article examines how reduction leads to clarity.

Minimalism isn't about emptiness, but about intentionality. Every element that remains must serve a purpose and contribute to the overall experience. This deliberate approach forces us to consider what's truly essential.

The space between elements - the negative space - becomes as important as the elements themselves. This breathing room allows the eye to rest and the mind to process, creating a more harmonious and effective design.
