Organization is key to productivity. How we structure our files and thoughts determines how efficiently we can retrieve and build upon them later.

A well-organized system reduces cognitive load and creates space for creativity to flourish. When we know where everything is, our minds are free to focus on the work itself rather than searching for what we need.

Consider how you organize your digital and physical spaces. Are they serving your workflow or hindering it? Small adjustments to your organizational systems can yield significant improvements in your creative output and mental clarity.
