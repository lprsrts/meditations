# Polymath Curriculum: A Journey Through the Epistemological Cycle

## I. Epistemological Cycle

The epistemological cycle describes the stages of deepening understanding across any discipline:

1. **Naïve Realism** – Belief in appearances or inherited assumptions
2. **Skepticism** – Doubt and recognition of contradictions
3. **Formalism** – Building symbolic/logical systems
4. **Abstraction** – Recognizing meta-patterns across systems
5. **Intuition Return** – Internalized, re-anchored understanding

---

## II. Curriculum Structure

- **Format**: Self-paced study through books, digital media, experiments, writing, and project-based work
- **Goal**: Create a well-rounded generalist with deep mastery in one domain
- **Approach**: Use the epistemological cycle in each domain; integrate cross-disciplinary insight
- **Target Audience**: Adults in their early 20s with access to a large library (digital or physical)

## G. Capstone Path: Master of One

Once broad exposure is complete, select a specialization to:

- Achieve deep theoretical understanding
- Apply skills through a real-world project (e.g., paper, prototype, research)
- Contribute knowledge or tools to the community

## Final Notes

- This curriculum is a **path of reconstruction**, not memorization.
- The learner must build—not just receive—understanding.
- The goal is a person who can **move between domains**, **see hidden structure**, and **act with mastery and integrity**.
